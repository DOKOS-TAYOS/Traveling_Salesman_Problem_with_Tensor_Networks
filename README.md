## 🎯 The Traveling Salesman Problem

The TSP is one of the most famous optimization challenges in computer science. Given a set of cities and distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Minimize: C(x⃗) = Σ(t=0 to n-1) T[x_t, x_{t+1}]
```
Where:
- `x_t` is the city visited at time step t
- `T[i,j]` is the distance between cities i and j  
- `x_n = x_0` (return to starting city)

**Constraints:**
- Each city must be visited exactly once
- The tour must form a complete cycle

## ⚛️ Tensor Network Algorithm

![Tensor Network Structure](TensorNetworkTSP.png)

The algorithm implements a quantum-inspired approach consisting of four main steps:

### 1. 🔄 Quantum Superposition Initialization
Creates uniform superposition vectors representing all possible city combinations simultaneously using tensor networks.

```python
# Creates uniform superposition of all possible routes
uniform_node = tk.Node(tensor=torch.ones(n_nodes), name='uniform')
```

### 2. 🌀 Imaginary Time Evolution  
Applies evolution operators that exponentially favor shorter routes through imaginary time evolution with parameter τ (tau).

```python
# Evolution tensor favoring shorter distances
evolution_tensor = torch.exp(-tau * distances)
```

### 3. 🛡️ Constraint Enforcement
Uses restriction layers to ensure each city is visited exactly once. More layers provide stronger constraints but slower computation.

### 4. 🎯 Solution Extraction
Extracts the optimal route from the quantum state through projection and partial trace operations.

### Key Parameters:
- **τ (Tau)**: Controls optimization intensity. Higher values favor shorter routes but risk numerical overflow
- **Restriction Layers**: Number of constraint layers. n-1 layers make the solver exact
- **Bond Dimension**: Controls accuracy vs computational cost trade-off

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sequential Solution (0,1,2,3...)**
- Solution: Reduce τ value
- Cause: Evolution too strong, favoring trivial path

**Repeated Cities in Solution**  
- Solution: Increase restriction layers
- Cause: Insufficient constraint enforcement

**Numerical Overflow**
- Solution: Reduce τ parameter
- Cause: Exponential evolution terms too large

**Slow Performance**
- Solution: Reduce problem size or layers
- Cause: Exponential scaling with problem size

### Performance Tips
- Start with small problems (5-7 cities) to understand behavior
- τ = 1.0 is usually a good starting point
- More layers = better quality but slower speed
- Symmetric distance matrices generally work better
